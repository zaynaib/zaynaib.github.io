# Quickie Intro to Github Page

This is my first hosted site on Github. I created it during the first week of the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp.
Github, is an online hosting service for version control of files that can also host websites for free.
Sites hosted by Github are simple static sites. This means that they can only be created using html,css and javascript.
Github pages cannot import databases like MySql  or content management system like WordPress/Drupal. You will have to use another hosting service like Heroku or Digial Ocean to host full stack applications.
Github pages is powered by Jekyll. If you want to customize your own theme you will need to use Jekyll. Jekyll is a static website generator that lets you use markdown to create a site. In order to use Jekyll you need to be familar with the Ruby programming language
